                <p>I am Justo Ochung' and i will be turning 33 years on Jan 1st 2024. I am interviewing for the role of School Lead Educator at TechLit Africa, a role that will enable me to meet future champions of the Tech industry.  
                    I was born in Kisumu, Western Kenya where i sat for my KCPE and KCSE exams. I later joined Kenyatta University and graduated with a honors degree in Biochemistry. 
                    <p>I started teaching in the local primary and secondary schools as a BOG teacher in my village even before the KCSE results were announced; i think this is where my passion for teaching started. 
                        I have to say, that i just graduated on Nov. 16th 2023 with a Post Graduate Diploma in Education, a training that will enable me get TSC certification as a Science teacher. </p>
                        <p>After graduating from Kenyatta University in 2014, it was a bit difficult to find jobs and that is how i started online freelance writing. I later joined Moringa School and graduated with a certification in software programming. 
                            As digital opportunities continue to open up, I am excited to share my experience as a digital worker and introduce the future market space for the upcoming graduates.</p>
